                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p><b>We are launching online food bank system for distribute the food for poor Peoples, Orphanage, Emergency shelters, Elders home and disabled Peoples. We collect the rest of the food from who are registered through our website and we pick-up the food and deliveries to the places where the food is needed. We also ready to get donations form the well-wishers and arrange the food a using the donation for needy Peoples. Rest of the Food donation system is a mission to end hunger and no wasting of food to make a hungry-free world. According to the latest survey, 1.3 billion tons of food is thrown as waste every year. Food donation may arise at any stage of the food production and distribution chain for a number of different reasons including. Difficulties in managing supply and demand, some food businesses may have a “surplus” of supply to meet orders and often orders for food may be cancelled resulting in excess stock. It is perfectly acceptable for this “surplus” food to be redistributed or donated by food donation to various charities, once the food is still in an acceptable condition and it is handled and distributed safely.The focus of this project is to reduce the amount of food wasted and being used to the needy people.</b></p>

                <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
                <p><b>Food Donation Connection manages food donation programs for food service companies interested in donating food. The donating process is based on donors receiving economic benefit through tax savings in addition to involvement with community and corporate goodwill.</b></p>
               <p><b>Donors are linked to those in need through existing non-profit hunger relief organizations.</b></p>
               <p><b>In Srilanka, The daily amount of food waste discarded by business establishment (e.g. food retailers and manufacturers, hotels and restaurants). While food may be unrelated to food safety (e.g. unattractive appearance or close to “best-before” date) and could have remained fit for human consumption. Should this discarded yet edible food (“surplus food”) be donated to food banks for distribution to those deprived of food, it can simultaneously meet multiple policy objectives such as welfare support to the needy, environmental protection and efficiency in resource allocation.</b></p>
              <p><b>This project provides the opportunity to develop a flagship process and collect the rest of the and distribute for redistribution from the food service sector for free. It eliminates the hunger of many people and gives them a way to live happily and comfortably.</b></p>
              <p><b>Mostly people when they want to donate some food, they are in looking for some bagger to safe their food from waste while in restaurants they also waste food in daily routine. So, we want to safe the food waste and provide food to the hungry people.</b></p>
              <p><b>Internet and smartphone are the major invention of this age and people are moving towards it very extensively so in that perspective our application will have the greatest scope in market. We are also using rest of the food donation system in our application which is the very fine feature of smartphone so it also plays a major role in increasing the scope of our application. Food safety matters, as well as guidelines and a seminar to help food banks across Sri-Lanka instigate similar operations. We can go to many places and introduce such a system and provide explanations to alleviate the hunger of many living beings in the world.</b></p>
